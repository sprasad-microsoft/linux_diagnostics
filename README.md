# Linux Diagnostics Controller (AODv2)

Real-time monitoring and automated diagnostics collection system for Linux environments using eBPF tools to detect anomalies and collect diagnostic data.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Sub-second detection of latency spikes and error patterns
- **Automated Diagnostics**: Instant collection of relevant system data when anomalies occur
- **Low Overhead Monitoring**: eBPF-based tools with minimal performance impact
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Customizable detection parameters for different environments
- **Intelligent Cleanup**: Automatic disk space management

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Linux kernel 5.15+ with eBPF support (6.8+ required for future eBPF scripts)
- Python 3.9+
- Root access for eBPF program loading

### Clone and Run
```bash
# Check Python version (requires 3.9+)
python3 --version

# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd linux_diagnostics

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
sudo python3 src/Controller.py 

# With debug logging
sudo AOD_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG python3 src/Controller.py 

# With minimal overhead
sudo python3 -O src/Controller.py 
```

### Stop the Application
```bash
# Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C
Ctrl+C
```

## 🏗️ System Architecture

AODv2 implements a multi-threaded architecture with five core components operating in a coordinated producer-consumer model:

### Core Components

- **Controller**: Main orchestrator managing all components, handles process lifecycle, thread supervision with automatic restart capabilities, and graceful shutdown coordination
- **EventDispatcher**: Collects events from eBPF programs via shared memory ring buffer, converts C structs to NumPy arrays, and queues events for analysis
- **AnomalyWatcher**: Analyzes event batches using pluggable handlers, detects anomalies based on configurable thresholds, and triggers diagnostic collection
- **LogCollector**: Executes diagnostic collection actions using async semaphore-bounded tasks, compresses logs with zstd, and organizes output by timestamp
- **SpaceWatcher**: Monitors disk usage autonomously, performs size-based and age-based cleanup to prevent disk space exhaustion

### Communication Flow

```
eBPF Programs → Shared Memory → EventDispatcher → eventQueue → AnomalyWatcher → anomalyActionQueue → LogCollector
```

**Inter-component Communication:**
- **Event Queue**: Thread-safe queue carrying monitoring events (NumPy arrays) from EventDispatcher to AnomalyWatcher
- **Anomaly Action Queue**: Task queue carrying anomaly actions from AnomalyWatcher to LogCollector
- **Shared Memory**: Ring buffer for lock-free communication between eBPF and Python processes

### Processing Model

**Event Processing:**
1. eBPF programs capture SMB events and write to shared memory ring buffer
2. EventDispatcher polls ring buffer, batches events for efficiency 
3. AnomalyWatcher processes events in configurable intervals with specialized handlers
4. Detected anomalies trigger LogCollector to execute QuickActions asynchronously
5. SpaceWatcher maintains disk space by cleaning old logs based on size/age thresholds

**Fault Tolerance:**
- Thread supervision with automatic restart on component failures
- Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup
- No event loss through ring buffer design and batch processing
